This is a minor bugfix update - please [see the last patch notes for the meaty Season 3 changes](/patch-notes/18a)!

Note also that this patch doesn't fix all the known bugs, either. There are several outstanding bugs that will be fixed in a later update.

## Bugfixes

- Fixed: Some UI graphics looked quite bad due to an increased compression level.
- Fixed: A burrow covered by oil would sometimes render behind the oil, instead of in front of it.
- Fixed: The camera would not move to where a character is unburrowing, even if it happened off-screen.
- Fixed/Changed: The Skill Rating leaderboard was not showing anyone, regardless of how many ranked games they'd played. It will now show anyone who has finished at least 1 ranked game.
- Fixed: When you cancel making a local game from the lobby screen, it would error out, causing the game to lock up.
- Fixed: Unable to see when fighters would respawn for 3rd or 4th (green or purple) players in game by selecting their base or one of their fighters.
- Improved: "Join Game", "Submit Turn", and "Surrender" actions have been improved on the server-side to run much more quickly.
- Improved: For online games, the turn indicator pop-up now says which player's turn it is (such as "Chalcidfly's Turn") rather than just "Enemy Turn".
- Improved: The in-game pause menu will now show other player's names in their team color.

## Gameplay changes

Most balance changes have been deferred to a later, more substantial update. However, there were a few quick changes that were quite fast to make, and unlikely to cause breakage in existing games.

### Robot Defragmenter

Thanks to `Marzeltine` in the Discord for pointing out that the Season 3 nerfs actually left Defragmenter in a weaker state than before his Season 2 buffs. **The change to bring `Sketchy Syringe`'s damage from 3 down to 2 has been reverted**.

Additionally, there was another change that was not noted in the 18a patch notes:
- When Daemon & Overlord (Robot & Critter summoners) deal themselves 1 damage at the beginning of their summoning ability, this damage will come directly from their health, bypassing any shield they may have.

### Robot Exterminator

- When `Taunt` is used against enemy abilities (such as Bazooka), it will no longer put that ability on cooldown.
- `Plasma Sword` **will no longer** ignite oil at the same time as hitting a fighter. This could be exploited to deal 5 damage to an enemy fighter with a single ability!
    - This change also means other hazards will not be hit if Exterminator is targetting an enemy fighter -- for instance, if he hit an enemy standing on top of water, the water would be simultaneously be turned into smoke.
    - When hitting an acid bubble, Plasma Sword will now turn it appropriately into acid, rather than double-hitting it and turning the acid into smoke.
    - These changes also apply to `Robot Automechanic`, who has the same `Plasma Sword` ability.

### Robot Physics Engine

Physics Engine's main attack, `Forklift`, can now target friendly fighters! It won't deal any damage, just push them. This can now be used to unlock the `Omnibus` unlock condition of pushing a fighter onto a teleporter.

### Acid/Water turning to Smoke

Up until last patch, there was a relatively unknown rule in the game that said that if you create `fire` next to `acid` or `water`, the acid or water would turn into `smoke screen`:

![fire](/img/18b/fire.gif)

Last patch, in an effort to simplify the game a bit, I removed that rule. However, I didn't realize that it was actually useful to some people! So, as of this patch `18b`, **it has been added back into the game.** 

**TL;DR** Going forward, fire placed next to acid or water will cause it to boil into steam, or rather `smoke screen`, once again.
