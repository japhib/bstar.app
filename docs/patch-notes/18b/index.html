			<p>This is a minor bugfix update - please <a href="/patch-notes/18a">see the last patch notes for the meaty Season 3 changes</a>!</p>
<p>Note also that this patch doesn&rsquo;t fix all the known bugs, either. There are several outstanding bugs that will be fixed in a later update.</p>
<h2 id="bugfixes">Bugfixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed: Some UI graphics looked quite bad due to an increased compression level.</li>
<li>Fixed: A burrow covered by oil would sometimes render behind the oil, instead of in front of it.</li>
<li>Fixed: The camera would not move to where a character is unburrowing, even if it happened off-screen.</li>
<li>Fixed/Changed: The Skill Rating leaderboard was not showing anyone, regardless of how many ranked games they&rsquo;d played. It will now show anyone who has finished at least 1 ranked game.</li>
<li>Fixed: When you cancel making a local game from the lobby screen, it would error out, causing the game to lock up.</li>
<li>Fixed: Unable to see when fighters would respawn for 3rd or 4th (green or purple) players in game by selecting their base or one of their fighters.</li>
<li>Improved: &ldquo;Join Game&rdquo;, &ldquo;Submit Turn&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Surrender&rdquo; actions have been improved on the server-side to run much more quickly.</li>
<li>Improved: For online games, the turn indicator pop-up now says which player&rsquo;s turn it is (such as &ldquo;Chalcidfly&rsquo;s Turn&rdquo;) rather than just &ldquo;Enemy Turn&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Improved: The in-game pause menu will now show other player&rsquo;s names in their team color.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gameplay-changes">Gameplay changes</h2>
<p>Most balance changes have been deferred to a later, more substantial update. However, there were a few quick changes that were quite fast to make, and unlikely to cause breakage in existing games.</p>
<h3 id="robot-defragmenter">Robot Defragmenter</h3>
<p>Thanks to <code>Marzeltine</code> in the Discord for pointing out that the Season 3 nerfs actually left Defragmenter in a weaker state than before his Season 2 buffs. <strong>The change to bring <code>Sketchy Syringe</code>&rsquo;s damage from 3 down to 2 has been reverted</strong>.</p>
<p>Additionally, there was another change that was not noted in the 18a patch notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>When Daemon &amp; Overlord (Robot &amp; Critter summoners) deal themselves 1 damage at the beginning of their summoning ability, this damage will come directly from their health, bypassing any shield they may have.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="robot-exterminator">Robot Exterminator</h3>
<ul>
<li>When <code>Taunt</code> is used against enemy abilities (such as Bazooka), it will no longer put that ability on cooldown.</li>
<li><code>Plasma Sword</code> <strong>will no longer</strong> ignite oil at the same time as hitting a fighter. This could be exploited to deal 5 damage to an enemy fighter with a single ability!
<ul>
<li>This change also means other hazards will not be hit if Exterminator is targetting an enemy fighter &ndash; for instance, if he hit an enemy standing on top of water, the water would be simultaneously be turned into smoke.</li>
<li>When hitting an acid bubble, Plasma Sword will now turn it appropriately into acid, rather than double-hitting it and turning the acid into smoke.</li>
<li>These changes also apply to <code>Robot Automechanic</code>, who has the same <code>Plasma Sword</code> ability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="robot-physics-engine">Robot Physics Engine</h3>
<p>Physics Engine&rsquo;s main attack, <code>Forklift</code>, can now target friendly fighters! It won&rsquo;t deal any damage, just push them. This can now be used to unlock the <code>Omnibus</code> unlock condition of pushing a fighter onto a teleporter.</p>
<h3 id="acidwater-turning-to-smoke">Acid/Water turning to Smoke</h3>
<p>Up until last patch, there was a relatively unknown rule in the game that said that if you create <code>fire</code> next to <code>acid</code> or <code>water</code>, the acid or water would turn into <code>smoke screen</code>:</p>
<p><img src="/img/18b/fire.gif" alt="fire"></p>
<p>Last patch, in an effort to simplify the game a bit, I removed that rule. However, I didn&rsquo;t realize that it was actually useful to some people! So, as of this patch <code>18b</code>, <strong>it has been added back into the game.</strong></p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Going forward, fire placed next to acid or water will cause it to boil into steam, or rather <code>smoke screen</code>, once again.</p>
