			<p>This patch mainly consists of bugfixes relating to changes made in the last patch, 17a (the one that introduced the beginning of season 2). Here&rsquo;s a big ol&rsquo; list of &rsquo;em.</p>
<h2 id="bugfixes">Bugfixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>When an ability shoves a fighter into cover, it didn&rsquo;t deal damage to the cover. Now it does.</li>
<li>For the purposes of unlocking Catalyst, &ldquo;electrify&rdquo; wouldn&rsquo;t count as stun. Now it does.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where shooting an acid bubble created a smokescreen tile instead of an acid tile.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where if a Punk used its electrifying Overload ability while standing on a line of water (i.e. from Amphibian), it could deal more than 1 damage based on how many water tiles the ability hit directly.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where using flamethrower on a tile that contained oil would deal double damage.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug causing Beast not to explode into acid on death in certain scenarios.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where if Medic used Electric Punch on an enemy and killed that enemy, Medic would stun herself.</li>
<li>Corrected Electric Punch tooltip and several others that said the ability had range 0.</li>
<li>Fixed teleporter directions for the Yellow teleporter on the Island map to be actually symmetrical.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug causing Commando to lose the temporary shield it got from its Charge ability immediately at the end of its own turn.</li>
<li>Fix for Catalyst being able to &ldquo;wake up&rdquo; a stunned unit by giving it more movement.</li>
<li>Fix for double badges showing up in player profiles.</li>
<li>Fix for unit pathing to avoid land mines when possible.</li>
<li>Fix for Amphibian&rsquo;s Spray Water ability no longer shooting water further when it targets existing water.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug causing a brief white flash on-screen when a unit got a shield for the first time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="balance-changes">Balance Changes</h2>
<p>There were also a few balance changes that made it into this patch:</p>
<h3 id="critter-_the-beast_">Critter <em>The Beast</em></h3>
<p>The Beast, one of the exciting new units introduced last patch, came out of the gate a bit too strong. With high movement and health and its former primary attack Stomp, it was too much of a better version of the Grump. This change removes Beast&rsquo;s oppressive high-damage, large AOE attack, so Stomp is purely Grump&rsquo;s signature move now. It replaces it with a melee attack that does 3 damage to the enemy, while also dealing 1 damage to itself. This leans more heavily into The Beast&rsquo;s goal of being a self-damaging powerhouse that chooses its own time of explosive death.</p>
<p><code>Bash: Beast uses its body to bash an enemy, oblivious to the harm it causes to itself. Deals 1 damage to self.</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>Damage 3</code></li>
<li><code>Range 1</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="critter-gargoyle">Critter Gargoyle</h3>
<p>Gargoyle&rsquo;s changes have landed nicely. Gargoyle is now an extremely mobile unit, and can dish out damage as well as healing teammates. However, its heal ability still had a cooldown of 0 &ndash; a remnant of a past where we were trying to compensate for its low overall power level.</p>
<p><code>Transfusion</code> (healing ability)</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Cooldown: 0 -&gt; 1</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="matchmaking-changes">Matchmaking Changes</h2>
<p>One change has been made to matchmaking: the server now keeps track of the last 2 people you matched with through Quick Play, and will not match you with them until you match with other people for a couple games. This should greatly reduce the number of times where you click &ldquo;Quick Play&rdquo; a few times and end up with 3 games against the same person.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s <em>possible</em> that this will negatively impact match times overall, leading to players having to wait longer for games in general - in that case, we can reduce the number of people the server won&rsquo;t match you with, or roll back this change completely. Let me know if you think this is a problem.</p>
